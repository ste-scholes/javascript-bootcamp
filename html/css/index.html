<h2>Position Statc - Default</h2>
<p>Static is the default position of HTML elements added to a page</p>
<p>Use the following to change how elements react</p>
<p>Static elements cannot have elements fixed absolutely to them</p>

<h2>Position - Relative</h2>
<p>Relative is removed from the document flow - this causes it to overlap rather than push other elements down</p>
<p>This isn't something we would usually use with top, right, left and bottom as it is difficult to style a document that has elements removed from it in this way</p>
<p class="code">
  .child-one { <br />
    &nbsp;   position: relative; <br />
    &nbsp;  left: 10px; <br />
    &nbsp;  top: 10px; <br />
} <br />
</p>

<h2>Position - Absolute</h2>
<p>Using position absolute is useful for positioning something in an exact location, where you don't want it to move.</p>
<p>It is essenially removed from the flow of the document, but can bepositioned using top, right, left and bottom</p>
<p>Absolute positioning positions the object absolutly relative to it's parent container</p>
<p class="imp">REMEMBER HTML elements are by default static, that means you cannot fix another element absolutly to them. You need to useful
  relative, absolute, sticky, or fixed in order to make an element fix absolutely inside it.
</p>
<p class="code">.parent { <br />
  &nbsp;  position: relative; <br />

} <br /> <br />

.child-one { <br />
  &nbsp;   position: absolute; <br />
  &nbsp;   top: 10px; <br />
} <br />

</p>

<h2>Position - Fixed</h2>
<p>Fixed position elements ignore all parent containers</p>
<p>They also stay in the same position, even when the page is scrolled</p>
<p>In the example code below, the child element one, stays in the position set in the code - 10px from the top, zero px from the left. It will retain this position regardless of scoling</p>
<p class="code">.parent { <br />
  &nbsp;  position: relative; <br />
  &nbsp;  height: 200vh; <br />

} <br /> <br />

.child-one { <br />
  &nbsp;   position: fixed; <br />
  &nbsp;  top: 10px; <br />
  &nbsp;   left: 0; <br />
}</p>


<h2>Position Sticky</h2>
<p>Sticky starts off rlative until it hits the top of the page where it becomes fixed if top: 0px as in example code</p>
<p>This is used where you see menu bars scroll up and then stick at the top of the page.</p>

<p class="code">.parent { <br /> 
  &nbsp;  position: relative; <br /> 
  &nbsp;   height: 200vh; <br /> 

} <br />  <br /> 

.child-one { <br /> 
  &nbsp;   position: sticky; <br /> 
  &nbsp;   top: 0px; <br /> 
 
}</p>
