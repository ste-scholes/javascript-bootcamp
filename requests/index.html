      <!-- <nav class="nav"></nav> -->
      <h2>Requests</h2>
      <!-- add content here -->
      <p>Requests use JavaScript to get data for finding information on a subject, logging into a site such as Facebook, fetching information from a database.</p>
     
      <h2>AJAX and AJAJ</h2>
     <p class="bold">AJAX - Asynchronous, Javascript and XML</p>
     <p class="bold">AJAJ - Asynchronous, Javascript and JSON</p>
     <p>AJAX  - The thinking behind this is that we are communicating with a server between page loads, we can send data to or retrieve data from a server whilst the page stays the same</p>
     <p>The communication is happening while we are on the page in the background, the information is brough into the current page</p>
     <p>In the past the responce was in XML</p>
     <p>Now it is usually JSON</p>



     <h2>XMLHTTP</h2>
     <p>This is the old standard, that was difficult to remember, was ugly and not straight forward to understand</p>
     <p>The original way of sending requests via JS</p>
     <p>Does not support promises, so there a lot of callbacks</p>
     <p>Clunky syntax that can be difficult to remember</p>
     <p>Odd use of capitalisation</p>
     
     <h2>FETCH</h2>
     <p>This is a new way of making requets, much better than the XMLHTTP version</p>
     
     <h2>AXIOS</h2>
     <p>This is a library a thrid party product that helps make requests</p>
