      <h2>Async Await</h2>
      <p class="bold">Introduction</p>
      <p>
        Often in web development, we need to handle asynchronous actions—
        actions we can wait on while moving on to other tasks. We make requests
        to networks, databases, or any number of similar operations. JavaScript
        is non-blocking: instead of stopping the execution of code while it
        waits, JavaScript uses an event-loop which allows it to efficiently
        execute other tasks while it awaits the completion of these asynchronous
        actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally, JavaScript used callback functions to handle asynchronous
        actions. The problem with callbacks is that they encourage complexly
        nested code which quickly becomes difficult to read, debug, and scale.
        With ES6, JavaScript integrated native promises which allow us to write
        significantly more readable code. JavaScript is continually improving,
        and ES8 provides a new syntax for handling our asynchronous action,
        async...await. The async...await syntax allows us to write asynchronous
        code that reads similarly to traditional synchronous, imperative
        programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The async...await syntax is syntactic sugar— it doesn’t introduce new
        functionality into the language, but rather introduces a new syntax for
        using promises and generators. Both of these were already built in to
        the language. Despite this, async...await powerfully improves the
        readability and scalability of our code. Let’s learn how to use it!
      </p>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>
        1. In this lesson, you’ll be given a code-editor to write your code and
        a bash terminal to execute your code. To execute your program, you’ll
        type node app.js in the terminal and hit enter (or return). You’ll press
        the “Check Work” button to submit your code for evaluation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Check out the code we provided. It shows three ways of accomplishing the
        same task: reading and printing from two files in a specified order:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The first version uses callback functions.</li>
        <li>The second version uses native promise syntax</li>
        <li>The third version uses async...await.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Don’t worry about understanding the async...await syntax— that’s what
        you’ll learn in this lesson! If you haven’t already, type node app.js
        into the terminal and press enter. Then, press “Check Work”.
      </p>

      <h2>Program Code</h2>
      <p class="code">
        const fs = require('fs');<br />
        const promisifiedReadfile = require('./promisifiedReadfile');<br /><br />
        <span class="correct">
          // Here we use fs.readfile() and callback functions:</span
        >
        <br /><br />
        fs.readFile('./file.txt', 'utf-8', (err, data) => {<br />
        if (err) throw err;<br />
        let firstSentence = data;<br />
        fs.readFile('./file2.txt', 'utf-8', (err, data) => {<br />
        if (err) throw err;<br />
        &nbsp; let secondSentence = data;<br />
        &nbsp; console.log(firstSentence, secondSentence);<br />
        });<br />
        });<br /><br />

        <span class="correct">
          // Here we use native promises with our "promisified" version of
          readfile:</span
        ><br /><br />
        let firstSentence;<br />
        promisifiedReadfile('./file.txt', 'utf-8')<br />
        .then((data) => {<br />
        &nbsp; firstSentence = data;<br />
        &nbsp; return promisifiedReadfile('./file2.txt', 'utf-8');<br />
        })<br />
        .then((data) => {<br />
        &nbsp; let secondSentence = data;<br />
        &nbsp; console.log(firstSentence, secondSentence)<br />
        })<br />
        .catch((err) => {console.log(err)});<br /><br />

        <span class="correct">
          // Here we use promisifiedReadfile() again but instead of using the
          native promise .then() syntax, we declare and invoke an async/await
          function:</span
        >
        <br /><br />
        async function readFiles() {<br />
        &nbsp; let firstSentence = await promisifiedReadfile('./file.txt',
        'utf-8');<br />
        &nbsp; let secondSentence = await promisifiedReadfile('./file2.txt',
        'utf-8');<br />
        &nbsp; console.log(firstSentence, secondSentence);<br />
        }<br /><br />

        readFiles();<br />
      </p>

      <p class="imp">The above code references two text files</p>
      <p class="code">file.txt</p>
      <p>Conatins the text: This is the first sentence.</p>
      <p class="code">file2.txt</p>
      <p>Contains the text: This is the second sentence.</p>
      <h2>Async Keyword</h2>

      <p>
        The async keyword is used to write functions that handle asynchronous
        actions. We wrap our asynchronous logic inside a function prepended with
        the async keyword. Then, we invoke that function.
      </p>
      <p class="code">
        async function myFunc() {<br />
        // Function body here<br />
        };<br /><br />

        myFunc();
      </p>

      <p>
        We’ll be using async function declarations throughout this lesson, but
        we can also create async function expressions:
      </p>
      <p class="code">
        const myFunc = async () => {<br />
        // Function body here<br />
        };<br /><br />

        myFunc();
      </p>
      <p>
        async functions always return a promise. This means we can use
        traditional promise syntax, like .then() and .catch with our async
        functions. An async function will return in one of three ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If there’s nothing returned from the function, it will return a
          promise with a resolved value of undefined.
        </li>
        <li>
          If there’s a non-promise value returned from the function, it will
          return a promise resolved to that value.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a promise is returned from the function, it will simply return that
          promise
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="code">
        async function fivePromise() { <br />
        return 5;<br />
        }<br /><br />

        fivePromise()<br />
        .then(resolvedValue => {<br />
        console.log(resolvedValue);<br />
        }) // Prints 5
      </p>

      <p>
        In the example above, even though we return 5 inside the function body,
        what’s actually returned when we invoke fivePromise() is a promise with
        a resolved value of 5.
      </p>

      <h2>Async Await</h2>
      <p class="bold">The await Operator</p>
      <p>
        In the last exercise, we covered the async keyword. By itself, it
        doesn’t do much; async functions are almost always used with the
        additional keyword await inside the function body.
      </p>
      <p>
        The await keyword can only be used inside an async function. await is an
        operator: it returns the resolved value of a promise. Since promises
        resolve in an indeterminate amount of time, await halts, or pauses, the
        execution of our async function until a given promise is resolved.
      </p>
      <p>
        In most situations, we’re dealing with promises that were returned from
        functions. Generally, these functions are through a library, and, in
        this lesson, we’ll be providing them. We can await the resolution of the
        promise it returns inside an async function. In the example below,
        myPromise() is a function that returns a promise which will resolve to
        the string "I am resolved now!".
      </p>
      <p class="code">
        async function asyncFuncExample(){<br />
        let resolvedValue = await myPromise();<br />
        console.log(resolvedValue);<br />
        }<br /><br />

        asyncFuncExample(); // Prints: I am resolved now!
      </p>
      <p>
        Within our async function, asyncFuncExample(), we use await to halt our
        execution until myPromise() is resolved and assign its resolved value to
        the variable resolvedValue. Then we log resolvedValue to the console.
        We’re able to handle the logic for a promise in a way that reads like
        synchronous code.
      </p>

      <h2>library.js code</h2>

      <p class="code">
        <span class="correct">
          /* this is the brainstormDinner function. It's a little silly. It
          returns a promise that uses a series of setTimeout() functions to
          simulate a time-consuming asynchronous action. It's a good example of
          "callback hell" or "the pyramid of doom," two ways people describe how
          confusing a bunch of nested callback functions can become. */</span
