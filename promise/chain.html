      <h2>Chaining Multiple Promises</h2>

      <p>
        One common pattern we’ll see with asynchronous programming is multiple
        operations which depend on each other to execute or that must be
        executed in a certain order. We might make one request to a database and
        use the data returned to us to make another request and so on! Let’s
        illustrate this with another cleaning example, washing clothes:
      </p>
      <p>
        We take our dirty clothes and put them in the washing machine. If the
        clothes are cleaned, then we’ll want to put them in the dryer. After the
        dryer runs, if the clothes are dry, then we can fold them and put them
        away.
      </p>
      <p>
        This process of chaining promises together is called composition.
        Promises are designed with composition in mind! Here’s a simple promise
        chain in code:
      </p>
      <p class="code">
        firstPromiseFunction() <br />
        .then((firstResolveVal) => {<br />
        return secondPromiseFunction(firstResolveVal);<br />
        })<br />
        .then((secondResolveVal) => {<br />
        console.log(secondResolveVal);<br />
        });
      </p>

      <p>Let’s break down what’s happening in the example:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          We invoke a function firstPromiseFunction() which returns a promise.
        </li>
        <li>
          We invoke .then() with an anonymous function as the success handler.
        </li>
        <li>
          Inside the success handler we return a new promise— the result of
          invoking a second function, secondPromiseFunction() with the first
          promise’s resolved value.
        </li>
        <li>
          We invoke a second .then() to handle the logic for the second promise
          settling.
        </li>
        <li>
          Inside that .then(), we have a success handler which will log the
          second promise’s resolved value to the console.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In order for our chain to work properly, we had to return the promise
        secondPromiseFunction(firstResolveVal). This ensured that the return
        value of the first .then() was our second promise rather than the
        default return of a new promise with the same settled value as the
        initial.
      </p>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>
        1. Take a look at the provided code. We require in three functions:
        checkInventory(), processPayment(), shipOrder(). These functions each
        return a promise.
      </p>
      <p>
        checkInventory() expects an order argument and returns a promise. If
        there are enough items in stock to fill the order, the promise will
        resolve to an array. The first element in the resolved value array will
        be the same order and the second element will be the total cost of the
        order as a number.
      </p>
      <p>
        processPayment() expects an array argument with the order as the first
        element and the purchase total as the second. This function returns a
        promise. If there is a large enough balance on the giftcard associated
        with the order, it will resolve to an array. The first element in the
        resolved value array will be the same order and the second element will
        be a tracking number.
      </p>
      <p>
        shipOrder() expects an array argument with the order as the first
        element and a tracking number as the second. It returns a promise which
        resolves to a string confirming the order has shipped.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’d like, look at the library.js file to see how these functions
        work. Press “Check Work” when you’re ready to move on to the next
        checkpoint.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. We set up a promise chain but it’s missing a couple important lines
        of code to make it function properly.
      </p>

      <p>
        We invoked checkInventory() with order and chained a .then() function to
        it. This .then() has an anonymous function as its success handler, but
        it’s missing a return statement. <br />

        The success handler should return a processPayment() promise.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. We have a second .then() function on the chain. This .then() also has
        an anonymous function as its success handler and is missing a return
        statement. <br />

        The success handler should return a shipOrder() promise.
      </p>
      <p>4. Type node app.js in the terminal and hit enter. NOT RELEVANT</p>
