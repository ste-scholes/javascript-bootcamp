      <h2>Using catch() with Promises</h2>
      <p>
        One way to write cleaner code is to follow a principle called separation
        of concerns. Separation of concerns means organizing code into distinct
        sections each handling a specific task. It enables us to quickly
        navigate our code and know where to look if something isn’t working.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember, .then() will return a promise with the same settled value as
        the promise it was called on if no appropriate handler was provided.
        This implementation allows us to separate our resolved logic from our
        rejected logic. Instead of passing both handlers into one .then(), we
        can chain a second .then() with a failure handler to a first .then()
        with a success handler and both cases will be handled.
      </p>
      <p class="code">
        prom<br>
         .then((resolvedValue) => { <br>
            &nbsp;  console.log(resolvedValue);<br>
         })<br>
        .then(null, (rejectionReason) => { <br>
            &nbsp;  console.log(rejectionReason);<br>
         });<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since JavaScript doesn’t mind whitespace, we follow a common convention
        of putting each part of this chain on a new line to make it easier to
        read. To create even more readable code, we can use a different promise
        function: .catch().
      </p>
      <p>
        The .catch() function takes only one argument, onRejected. In the case
        of a rejected promise, this failure handler will be invoked with the
        reason for rejection. Using .catch() accomplishes the same thing as
        using a .then() with only a failure handler.
      </p>
      <p>Let’s look at an example using .catch():</p>
      <p class="code">
        prom <br>
        .then((resolvedValue) => { <br>
            &nbsp;   console.log(resolvedValue); <br>
        })<br>
        .catch((rejectionReason) => { <br>
            &nbsp;  console.log(rejectionReason); <br>
        });<br>
      </p>
      <p>Let’s break down what’s happening in the example code:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          prom is a promise which randomly either resolves with 'Yay!' or
          rejects with 'Ohhh noooo!'.
        </li>
        <li>
          We pass a success handler to .then() and a failure handler to
          .catch().
        </li>
        <li>
          If the promise resolves, .then()‘s success handler will be invoked
          with 'Yay!'.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the promise rejects, .then() will return a promise with the same
          rejection reason as the original promise and .catch()‘s failure
          handler will be invoked with that rejection reason.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Code Example</h2>
      <p class="code">const {checkInventory} = require('./library.js');<br /><br />

        const order = [['sunglasses', 1], ['bags', 2]];<br /><br />
        
        const handleSuccess = (resolvedValue) => <br />{
            &nbsp;     console.log(resolvedValue);<br />
        };<br /><br />
        
        const handleFailure = (rejectReason) => {<br />
            &nbsp;    console.log(rejectReason);<br />
        };<br /><br />
        
        // Write your code below:<br /><br />
        
        checkInventory(order).then(handleSuccess)<br />
        .catch(handleFailure)</p><br />

        <p class="imp">The above code will fail as there aren't any sunglasses</p>

        <p>library.js</p>
        <p class="code">const inventory = {  <br />
            &nbsp;    sunglasses: 0, <br />
            &nbsp;    pants: 1088, <br />
            &nbsp;   bags: 1344 <br />
          }; <br /> <br />
          
          const checkInventory = (order) => { <br />
            &nbsp;  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { <br />
                  setTimeout(() => { <br />
                    &nbsp;  let inStock = order.every(item => inventory[item[0]] >= item[1]); <br />
                      if (inStock) { <br />
                        &nbsp;   resolve(`Thank you. Your order was successful.`); <br />
                      } else { <br />
                        &nbsp;    reject(`We're sorry. Your order could not be &nbsp; completed <br /> because some items are sold out.`); <br />
                        &nbsp;  } <br />
                        &nbsp; &nbsp;  }, 1000); <br />
                  &nbsp;   }); <br />
          }; <br /> <br />
          
          module.exports = {checkInventory};</p>
