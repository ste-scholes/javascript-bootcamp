      <h2>Using Promise.all()</h2>

      <p>
        When done correctly, promise composition is a great way to handle
        situations where asynchronous operations depend on each other or
        execution order matters. What if we’re dealing with multiple promises,
        but we don’t care about the order? Let’s think in terms of cleaning
        again. For us to consider our house clean, we need our clothes to dry,
        our trash bins emptied, and the dishwasher to run. We need all of these
        tasks to complete but not in any particular order. Furthermore, since
        they’re all getting done asynchronously, they should really all be
        happening at the same time! To maximize efficiency we should use
        concurrency, multiple asynchronous operations happening together. With
        promises, we can do this with the function Promise.all(). Promise.all()
        accepts an array of promises as its argument and returns a single
        promise. That single promise will settle in one of two ways: If every
        promise in the argument array resolves, the single promise returned from
        Promise.all() will resolve with an array containing the resolve value
        from each promise in the argument array. If any promise from the
        argument array rejects, the single promise returned from Promise.all()
        will immediately reject with the reason that promise rejected. This
        behavior is sometimes referred to as failing fast. Let’s look at a code
        example:
      </p>

      <p class="code">
        let myPromises = Promise.all([returnsPromOne(),<br />
        returnsPromTwo(), returnsPromThree()]); <br />
        <br />
        myPromises<br />
        .then((arrayOfValues) => {<br />
        &nbsp; console.log(arrayOfValues);<br />
        })<br />
        .catch((rejectionReason) => {<br />
        &nbsp; console.log(rejectionReason);<br />
        });<br />
      </p>
      <p>Let’s break down what’s happening:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We declare myPromises assigned to invoking Promise.all().</li>
        <li>
          We invoke Promise.all() with an array of three promises— the returned
          values from functions.
        </li>
        <li>
          We invoke .then() with a success handler which will print the array of
          resolved values if each promise resolves successfully.
        </li>
        <li>
          We invoke .catch() with a failure handler which will print the first
          rejection message if any promise rejects.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>
        1. Our business is doing so well that we’re running low on inventory. We
        want to reach out to some distributors to see if they have the items we
        need. We only want to make one restocking order, so we’ll only want to
        place the order if all of the items are available. Take a look at the
        provided code. We require in one function: checkAvailability().
        checkAvailability() expects two string arguments: an item and a
        distributor. It returns a promise. The function simulates checking that
        the given distributor has a given item. 80% of the time it will resolve
        the promise with the item, and 20% of the time it will reject the
        promise with an error message stating that the item isn’t available. We
        also provided two functions which will serve as success and failure
        handlers. If you’d like, look at the library.js file to see how these
        functions work. Press “Check Work” when you’re ready to move on to the
        next checkpoint.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Create three variables each assigned to a separate promise:
        checkSunglasses should be assigned the value returned from invoking
        checkAvailability() with 'sunglasses' as its first argument and
        'Favorite Supply Co.' as its second argument. checkPants should be
        assigned the value returned from invoking checkAvailability() with
        'pants' as its first argument and 'Favorite Supply Co.' as its second
        argument. checkBags should be assigned the value returned from invoking
        checkAvailability() with 'bags' as its first argument and 'Favorite
        Supply Co.' as its second argument.
      </p>

      <p>
        3. Invoke Promise.all() with an array containing checkSunglasses,
        checkPants, and checkBags.
      </p>

      <p>
        4. Chain a .then() to the promise returned from Promise.all(). You
        should pass in onFulfill to serve as the success handler.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. Add a .catch() to the chain. You should pass in onReject to serve as
        the failure handler.
      </p>

      <p>
        6. Type node app.js in the terminal and hit enter to execute your
        program.
      </p>

      <p>Example code</p>
      <p class="code">const {checkAvailability} = require('./library.js'); <br /> <br />

        const onFulfill = (itemsArray) => { <br />
          console.log(`Items checked: ${itemsArray}`); <br />
          console.log(`Every item was available from the distributor. Placing order now.`); <br />
        }; <br />
        
        const onReject = (rejectionReason) => { <br />
          console.log(rejectionReason); <br />
        }; <br /> <br />
        
        // Write your code below: <br />
        const checkSunglasses = checkAvailability('sunglasses','Favorite Supply Co.') <br /> <br />
        
        const checkPants = checkAvailability('pants','Favorite Supply Co.') <br />
        const checkBags = checkAvailability('bags','Favorite Supply Co.') <br /> <br />
        
        Promise.all([checkSunglasses,checkPants,checkBags]) <br />
        &nbsp;.then(onFulfill) <br />
        &nbsp; .catch(onReject)</p>

        <h2>Project code library.js</h2>
      <p class="code">const checkAvailability = (itemName, distributorName) => { <br />
        console.log(`Checking availability of ${itemName} at ${distributorName}...`); <br />
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { <br />
            setTimeout(() => { <br />
                if (restockSuccess()) { <br />
                  &nbsp;     console.log(`${itemName} are in stock at ${distributorName}`) <br />
                  &nbsp;      resolve(itemName); <br />
                } else { <br />
                  &nbsp;     reject(`Error: ${itemName} is unavailable from ${distributorName} at this time.`); <br />
                } <br />
            }, 1000); <br />
        }); <br />
    }; <br /> <br />
    
    module.exports = { checkAvailability }; <br /> <br />
    
    
    // This is a function that returns true 80% of the time <br />
    // We're using it to simulate a request to the distributor being successful this often <br />
    function restockSuccess() { <br />
        return (Math.random() > .2); <br />
    }</p>
