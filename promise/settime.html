      <h2>The Node setTimeout() Function</h2>

      <p>
        Knowing how to construct a promise is useful, but most of the time,
        knowing how to consume, or use, promises will be key. Rather than
        constructing promises, you’ll be handling Promise objects returned to
        you as the result of an asynchronous operation. These promises will
        start off pending but settle eventually.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moving forward, we’ll be simulating this by providing you with functions
        that return promises which settle after some time. To accomplish this,
        we’ll be using setTimeout(). setTimeout() is a Node API (a comparable
        API is provided by web browsers) that uses callback functions to
        schedule tasks to be performed after a delay. setTimeout() has two
        parameters: a callback function and a delay in milliseconds.
      </p>
      <p class="code">
        const delayedHello = () => {<br />
        console.log('Hi! This is an asynchronous greeting!');<br />
        };<br /><br />

        setTimeout(delayedHello, 2000);
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, we invoke setTimeout() with the callback function delayedHello()
        and 2000. In at least two seconds delayedHello() will be invoked. But
        why is it “at least” two seconds and not exactly two seconds?
      </p>
      <p>
        This delay is performed asynchronously—the rest of our program won’t
        stop executing during the delay. Asynchronous JavaScript uses something
        called the event-loop. After two seconds, delayedHello() is added to a
        line of code waiting to be run. Before it can run, any synchronous code
        from the program will run. Next, any code in front of it in the line
        will run. This means it might be more than two seconds before
        delayedHello() is actually executed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let’s look at how we’ll be using setTimeout() to construct asynchronous
        promises:
      </p>

      <p class="code">
        const returnPromiseFunction = () => { <br />
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {<br />
        setTimeout(( ) => {resolve('I resolved!')}, 1000);<br />
        });<br />
        };<br /><br />

        const prom = returnPromiseFunction();
      </p>

      <p>
        In the example code, we invoked returnPromiseFunction() which returned a
        promise. We assigned that promise to the variable prom. Similar to the
        asynchronous promises you may encounter in production, prom will
        initially have a status of pending.
      </p>

      <h2>Code Example</h2>
      <p class="code">console.log("This is the first line of code in app.js.");<br />
        // Keep the line above as the first line of code<br />
        // Write your code here:<br />
        const usingSTO = () => {<br />
          console.log('Hello World')<br />
        }<br />
        setTimeout(usingSTO, 3000)<br /><br /><br /><br />
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        // Keep the line below as the last line of code:<br />
        console.log("This is the last line of code in app.js.");</p>
        <p>The result of the above code is: </p>
        <p>"This is the first line of code in app.js."</p>
        <p>"This is the last line of code in app.js."</p>
        <p><i>
            Then after a break of 3 seconds</i></p>
        <p>"Hello World"</p>
