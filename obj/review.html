  Letâ€™s review the concepts covered in this lesson:<br /><br />

  The object that a method belongs to is called the calling object.<br />
  The this keyword refers the calling object and can be used to access
  properties of the calling object.<br />
  Methods do not automatically have access to other internal properties of
  the calling object.<br />
  The value of this depends on where the this is being accessed from.<br />
  We cannot use arrow functions as methods if we want to access other
  internal properties.<br />
  JavaScript objects do not have built-in privacy, rather there are
  conventions to follow to notify other developers about the intent of the
  code.<br />
  The usage of an underscore before a property name means that the
  original developer did not intend for that property to be directly
  changed.<br />
  Setters and getter methods allow for more detailed ways of accessing and
  assigning properties.<br />
  Factory functions allow us to create object instances quickly and
  repeatedly.<br />
  There are different ways to use object destructuring: one way is the
  property value shorthand and another is destructured assignment.<br />
  As with any concept, it is a good skill to learn how to use the
  documentation with objects!<br />
