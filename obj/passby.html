<!-- start -->
    <p>
      Objects are passed by reference. This means when we pass a variable
      assigned to an object into a function as an argument, the computer
      interprets the parameter name as pointing to the space in memory holding
      that object. As a result, functions which change object properties
      actually mutate the object permanently (even when the object is assigned
      to a const variable).
    </p>
    <p class="code">
      const spaceship = { <br />
      homePlanet : 'Earth',<br />
      color : 'silver'<br />
      };<br />
      <br />
      let paintIt = obj => {<br />
      obj.color = 'glorious gold'<br />
      };<br /><br />

      paintIt(spaceship);<br /><br />

      spaceship.color // Returns 'glorious gold'<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      Our function paintIt() permanently changed the color of our spaceship
      object. However, reassignment of the spaceship variable wouldn’t work in
      the same way:
    </p>
    <p class="code">
      let spaceship = {<br />
      homePlanet : 'Earth',<br />
      color : 'red'<br />
      };<br />
      let tryReassignment = obj => {<br />
      obj = {<br />
      identified : false, <br />
      'transport type' : 'flying'<br />
      }<br />
      console.log(obj) // Prints {'identified': false, 'transport type':
      'flying'}<br /><br />

      };<br />
      tryReassignment(spaceship) // The attempt at reassignment does not
      work.<br />
      spaceship // Still returns {homePlanet : 'Earth', color : 'red'};<br /><br />

      spaceship = {<br />
      identified : false, <br />
      'transport type': 'flying'<br />
      }; // Regular reassignment still works.
    </p>

    <p>Let’s look at what happened in the code example:</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="points">
        We declared this spaceship object with let. This allowed us to
        reassign it to a new object with identified and 'transport type'
        properties with no problems.
      </li>
      <li class="points">
        When we tried the same thing using a function designed to reassign the
        object passed into it, the reassignment didn’t stick (even though
        calling console.log() on the object produced the expected result).
      </li>
      <li class="points">
        When we passed spaceship into that function, obj became a reference to
        the memory location of the spaceship object, but not to the spaceship
        variable. This is because the obj parameter of the tryReassignment()
        function is a variable in its own right. The body of tryReassignment()
        has no knowledge of the spaceship variable at all!
      </li>
      <li class="points">
        When we did the reassignment in the body of tryReassignment(), the obj
        variable came to refer to the memory location of the object
        {'identified' : false, 'transport type' : 'flying'}, while the
        spaceship variable was completely unchanged from its earlier value.
      </li>
    </ol>
